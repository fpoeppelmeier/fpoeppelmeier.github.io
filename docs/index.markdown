<div style="text-align: justify">
I am an Assistant Professor in Global Biogeochemical Modelling at the University of Bern, Switzerland, working on the reconstruction of ocean circulation and climate change during the Quaternary. With a background in isotope geochemistry and paleoceanography, I have transitioned to Earth system modelling, where I integrate direct reconstructions from marine sediments with model simulations. My research interests cover a broad range of topics, including the geochemical understanding of trace elements in the ocean and sediments used to reconstruct water mass properties, the stability conditions of the AMOC and it’s influence on the carbon cycle, and the interaction of continental ice sheets with the ocean during glacial-interglacial cycles.
